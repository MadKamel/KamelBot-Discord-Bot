# KamelBot
This discord bot is a project of mine that I've been working on lately. It provides services to help with managing a server such as automated role assignment (selfroles) and logging and pinging admins/mods on security incidents (invite activity, new members).

You can start up this bot at it's [Repl.IT website](https://kamelbot.madkamel.repl.co/) if you want to activate it.
